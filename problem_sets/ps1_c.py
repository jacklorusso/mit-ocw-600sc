# Problem 3
#
# Write a program that uses these bounds and bisection search (for more info check out the
# Wikipedia page here) to find the smallest monthly payment to the cent (no more multiples of
# $10) such that we can pay off the debt within a year. Try it out with large inputs, and notice how
# fast it is. Produce the output in the same format as you did in problem 2.
