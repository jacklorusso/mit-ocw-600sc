# Problem 1
#
# Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the
# minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.
#
# Use raw_input() to ask for the following three floating point numbers:
#   1. the outstanding balance on the credit card
#   2. annual interest rate
#   3. minimum monthly payment rate
#
# For each month, print the minimum monthly payment, remaining balance, principle paid in the
# format shown in the test cases. All numbers should be rounded to the nearest penny.
# Finally, print the result, which should include the total amount paid that year and the remaining
# balance.
